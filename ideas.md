# improvement ideas

- filter on articles, some are irrelevant e.g. talking about drinking apple juice instead of AAPL
- articles that are giving positive sentiment indication might include those just talking about the stock price going up, should these be included? maybe weighted slightly lower?
- need to be able to get more articles, more scoring aswell. therefore need to check if i can increase limits on GDELT and FinBERT
